/*
  This file contains all the numerical and probability values for potential
  substat rolls, organized into js objects. All information here was obtained
  from several sources:
    - the old Artifact Analysis spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQdCZN4lM23LNfSU36-zEKXC7sXBzeywSGhT1JW9SlqytYXHHFNVXos1yI0UPMqSyTU7KOe36mtjK9d/pubhtml)
    - the Artifacts pages on the Genshin Impact wiki (https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Artifacts and all associated pages)

  The data for all of these sources ultimately comes from Dimbreath's Genshin
  Impact datamine, which can be found at https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData.

  For the purposes of our analysis, the main stat of an artifact does not matter;
  it is assumed that users will only level up artifacts whose main stats they are
  actually interested in. Artifact main stats *do* affect our calculations in
  two places by slightly changing probability distributions, however, so it is
  still important for us to take them into account.
